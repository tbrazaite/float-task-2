                Newton was an
                English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the
                most influential
                men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered
                to be the most
                influential book in the history of science.

                Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically
                mass–energy
                equivalence,
                expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his
                services
                to Theoretical
                Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

                Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist and
                inventor of the
                modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many revolutionary
                contributions in the
                field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br><br>
